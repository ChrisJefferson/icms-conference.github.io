## 17. Math in 2050 - Creativity, Publication, and Application supported by Knowledge Bases and Software?

### Organizers

*   [Michael Kohlhase](mailto:michael.kohlhase@fau.de) (FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg)
*   [Patrick D. F. Ion](mailto:pion@umich.edu) (GDML WG & University of Michigan)

### Aim and Scope

The Math2050 Session explores community perceptions of future
workflows in "doing mathematics" (the conception, publication,
dissemination, and application of mathematical knowledge). It follows
upon an ICMS event in Berlin organized by the International Mathematical
Knowledge Trust ([IMKT](http://imkt.org); chartered by the IMU and funded
by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to help bring about a global digital
mathematics library).  The question of how to encode mathematical
semantics that is at the heart of what future mathematics will be,
was considered at a Fields Institute workshop in February 2016
and is still an active one.

### Topics and Publications

The workshop seeks technical contributions and position papers on
novel/computer-supported workflows and information resources for
the practice of the mathematical sciences. The contributions will
be used as anchors to an open discussion on how "doing mathematics
could change in the next 30 years (one full generation of
mathematicians).  The contributors will be invited to submit
articles to a special issue of "Mathematics in Computer Science".
