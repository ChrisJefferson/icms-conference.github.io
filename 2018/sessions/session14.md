### Aim and Scope

There is a wealth of mathematical software available today, most of which are
  free and open-source, but very specialised: for example nauty for graph
  isomorphism, Singular for polynomials, Pari for number theory. Additionally
  there are databases of objects like the OEIS, or the Small Group Library.
  
  In contemporary mathematics research, we use and combine these specialised
  tools, which requires domain-specific knowledge, data access and conversion,
  and low-level programming for interfacing between them.

  This is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale: Addressing the demand for
  better composability there are huge software packages like SageMath, data
  description languages like OpenMath, and RPC mechanisms like SCSCP.

  The aim of this session is to provide a forum for developers and users of
  mathematical software with an interest in composablity and interoperability of,
  and knowledge and data exchange between systems, to share experiences, solutions,
  and a vision for the future.
