## Session 19. Formal and Informal Mathematical Corpora

### Organizers

*   [Robert Y. Lewis](mailto:rob.y.lewis@gmail.com) (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, NL)

### Aim and Scope

This session aims to connect a constellation of topics related to processing
corpora of mathematical texts. NLP on informal mathematical documents
presents many interesting challenges, and can be18.md aided by the presence of 
corresponding formal documents (interpreted broadly). Creating and maintaining
these corpora presents even more challenges. We hope to bring together
researchers thinking about the retrieval, curation, and interpretation   
of formal and informal mathematical texts, as well as the underlying languages
used in these projects and the connections between them. There are many exciting projects 
underway in all of these areas, and a combined session will spur fruitful
discussions and help to align the work of different groups.

#### Topics (including, but not limited to)

* The creation and curation of mathematical corpora (e.g. Hales'
  Formal Abstracts project)
* The parsing and interpreting of natural language mathematics into more
  formal domains (e.g. symbolic or AI techniques for mining and searching the arXiv)
* Target languages for these interpretations and the connections between them
  (e.g. computer algebra systems and proof assistants)
