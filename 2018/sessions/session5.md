## Session 5. The 29th OpenMath Workshop

### Organizers

*   [James Davenport](mailto:j.h.davenport@bath.ac.uk) (University of Bath, UK)
*   [Michael Kohlhase](mailto:michael.kohlhase@fau.de) (FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg)

### Aim and Scope

[OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org) is a language for exchanging
mathematical formulae across applications (such as computer algebra
systems). From 2010 its importance has increased in that OpenMath
Content Dictionaries were adopted as a foundation of the
[MathML 3 W3C recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML), the standard for
mathematical formulae on the Web.

### Topics:

The OpenMath Workshop is the annual meeting of the OpenMath
Society. 

  * Feature Requests (Standard Enhancement Proposals) and Discussions
    for going beyond OpenMath 2;
  * Further convergence of OpenMath and MathML 3;
  * Reasoning with OpenMath;
  * OpenMath on the Semantic Web;
  * New OpenMath Content Dictionaries;
  * Software using or processing OpenMath;

though others related to OpenMath are certainly welcomed. For examples
of contributions see the previous OpenMath workshops
