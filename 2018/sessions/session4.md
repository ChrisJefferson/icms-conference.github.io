## 4. Polyhedral methods in geometry and optimization 

### Organizers

*   [Michael Joswig](mailto:joswig@math.tu-berlin.de) (Institut für Mathematik der Technischen Universität Berlin)
*   [Yue Ren](mailto:yueren@mis.mpg.de) (Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften)

### Aim and Scope

Convex polyhedra occur in optimization as the feasible regions of linear programs.
Moreover, integer linear programming is the same as linear programming over the
convex hull of the lattice points in a polyhedron.
In algebraic geometry and its applications piecewise-linear shapes occur in the
guise of polyhedral fans.
Examples include secondary and Groebner fans, which play major roles, e.g., in
tropical geometry.
This session wants to bring together people working on algorithms and software
dealing with any of the above.


### Topics

Specific topics include, but are not restricted to, the following:
*    convex hull computations
*    mixed integer linear programming
*    explicit methods for triangulating point configurations
*    computations in toric or tropical geometry
*    parallelization of polyhedral computations
*    polyhedral methods in algebraic statistics
*    algorithms exploiting symmetry in any of the above
