### Aim and Scope

Backtrack search is a vital part of solving many problems in computational group
  theory, such as graph isomorphism, finding (non-point) stabilisers and
  normalisers in permutation groups, finding canonical images of objects under a
  group action, or short solutions to equations over a free group.

  Efficient backtrack search implementations require a symbiosis of efficient algorithms,
  high-performance code, and sophisticated mathematical methods to prune search
  space. Some of the most prominent backtrack methods in computational mathematics
  are McKay's graph isomorphism algorithm, Jeffrey Leon's partition backtrack
  method for permutation groups, and Bernd Schmalz' "snakes and ladders" algorithm.

  Many breakthroughs in AI-search, such as learning, heuristics and parallelism,
  can improve performance by multiple orders of magnitude, and are applicable in
  computational group theory.

### Topics

  We would like to invite experts from AI, combinatorics, computational group
  theory and related areas with the aim of sharing and exchanging ideas, problems,
  results and implementations.
