## 13. Symbolic Combinatorics 

### Organizers

*   [Stephen Melczer](mailto:smelczer@sas.upenn.edu) (University of Pennsylvania)

### Aim and Scope

Symbolic Combinatorics is roughly defined as the application of symbolic algorithms to problems in enumerative and algebraic combinatorics.  This session aims to publicize recent algorithms, software implementations, and various applications.

### Topics

Topics include the manipulation of generating functions, algorithms for asymptotics, and the study of multivariate integer sequences.
