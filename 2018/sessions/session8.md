### Aim and Scope


While there has been some discussion on how Computer Algebra Systems could be used for AI there is little literature on applications in the other direction.  However, recent results for quantifier elimination suggest that given enough example problems there is scope for tools like Support Vector Machines to improve the performance of Computer Algebra Systems.  It may seem that the inherently probabilistic nature of machine learning tools would invalidate the exact mathematical results prized by such software, however, algorithms and implementations often come with a range of choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the end result but a great effect on the resources required to find it.  This sessions aims to promote thought on whether, where, and how best machine learning could be applied to mathematical software development.
